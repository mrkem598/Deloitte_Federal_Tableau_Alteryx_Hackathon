The Federal Tableau + Alteryx Hackathon is a chance for federal practitioners to showcase their Tableau and Alteryx  skills in solving problems.

# Project Story
***
 
### Comparing SSDI disability requests against chronic illnesses and economic status
### Analysis within CDI (e.g. smoking and asthma correlation, or alcohol consumption against alcohol taxes and laws)
### Comparing CDI factors with drug overdose statistics
### Noticed that rates for high school alcohol and TV use consistently dropped – hypothesis is that this is being replaced by phone/computer use (interesting concept but data is pretty sparse)

***
# Project Submision Format
***
### PPT slides (2 – one for methodology, one for findings)
### Packaged Tableau workbook extract in zipped file
### Packaged Alteryx workflow
